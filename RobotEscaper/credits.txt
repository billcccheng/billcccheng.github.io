I am a 22 year-old student from Taiwan.
This is my first game developing with Unity.

It used to be a practicing work at first,
but I couldn't help keeping adding new features to make it complete *_*

With some private reasons, 
I decided to release the incomplete game.

Because of my web host, the server would be unstable these days.
Sorry about that:(

Any suggestion is welcomed, feel free to talk here;)
