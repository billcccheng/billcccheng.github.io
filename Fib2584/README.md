# Fib2584Ai

The ever-popular 2048, but using [Fibonacci numbers](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) instead of powers of two. In this version, instead of tiles with equal numbers being combinable, tiles with numbers that are consecutive in the Fibonacci sequence are combinable (and will create tiles with their sum).

It also includes an AI which is trained by TD-Learning. For more information, please visit [here]().

Fork from a [checker-free version](//oxguy3.github.io/2048-Fibonacci/) of [2584](//joshlf13.github.io/2048-Fibonacci/), which is a small fork of [2048](//gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), which is a clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

## Contributing
Anyone can fork this to fit your AI, feel free to ask questions if you need some help:)

However, there is no trained database included. If you find your clone can't be executed properly, it's normal.
